# Instructions
# Set up artifacts and add their locations and categories on new rows
# e.g. a backpack at marker 0 is written '0: Backpack'
# Labels are case sensitive to match DARPA conventions
# Choose from [Backpack, Fire Extinguisher, Cell Phone, Survivor, Drill] with '_n' as a suffix
# This allows unique identification of them
# e.g. 1: Backpack_2
# If there is no artifact at a given location, it is not required to add an entry
